# Agent Context — The Forge

**Read this first if you're an AI model operating inside The Forge.**

This file orients you so you don't hallucinate tools, loop on broken assumptions,
or confuse the project state. Every model (Qwen, Ollama, GPT, Claude, Grok)
should treat this as ground truth.

---

## What This Project Is

The Forge is an autonomous agent OS. You submit a task, a 16-agent planner
council creates a plan, then a single executor carries it out using 40+ tools.
It runs as a Flask web app on `localhost:5000`.

**You are NOT a standalone chatbot.** You are an executor inside a pipeline.
The tools listed below are your only interface to the world. Do not fabricate
tools, APIs, or capabilities that aren't listed here.

---

## Your Available Tools

These are the ONLY tools you can call. If a tool isn't here, you cannot use it.

### Core (always available)
- `read_file(path)` — read file contents
- `write_file(path, content)` — write/create a file
- `list_directory(path)` — list files in a directory
- `find_files(pattern, path)` — glob search for files
- `grep_files(pattern, path)` — regex search file contents
- `run_command(command)` — execute shell command (30s timeout)
- `escalate_to_human(reason, category, context)` — ask the human for help

### Extended (available when pack/step allows)
- `run_python(code)` — execute Python code, capture stdout/stderr
- `git_status()`, `git_diff()`, `git_commit(message)`, `git_log()`
- `http_get(url)`, `http_post(url, body)`
- `browser_navigate(url)`, `browser_screenshot()`, `browser_click(selector)`,
  `browser_type(selector, text)`, `browser_extract_text()`, `browser_info()`
- `query_sqlite(db_path, query)`
- `resize_image(path, width, height)`, `convert_image(path, format)`
- `zip_files(paths, output)`, `extract_archive(path, dest)`
- `copy_to_clipboard(text)`, `read_clipboard()`
- `render_widget(widget_type, title, html)` — render interactive HTML in UI

### Email (requires ARC-Relay API key)
- `email_check_dmarc(domain)`, `email_check_health(domain)`
- `email_list_domains()`, `email_add_domain(domain)`, `email_verify_domain(domain)`
- `email_list_aliases(domain)`, `email_create_alias(domain, alias)`
- `email_get_logs(domain)`, `email_block_sender(domain, sender)`
- `email_get_analytics(domain)`

### Trading (requires Tradier or yfinance)
- `get_market_quote(ticker)` — current price, change, volume for a ticker
- `get_pcr(ticker)` — put/call ratio and options sentiment
- `get_portfolio()` — current positions and P&L
- `execute_trade(ticker, side, quantity)` — buy/sell (paper or live)
- `set_alert(metric, threshold, direction)` — set a trading alert

**Important:** `get_market_quote` returns a SINGLE current snapshot (price,
change, volume). It does NOT return historical data, intraday candles, or
time series. If you need historical price data, use `run_python` with
`yfinance` (which IS installed as a project dependency).

## What You Cannot Do

Do not attempt any of these — they will fail or produce garbage:

1. **Fabricate tools.** There is no `search_web`, `browse_internet`,
   `call_api`, `send_email_directly`, or `download_file` tool. Use
   `http_get`/`http_post` for web requests, `run_command` for downloads.

2. **Install packages at runtime.** Dependencies are managed via
   `pyproject.toml`. Do not run `pip install` unless the user explicitly
   asks. Key packages already installed: `yfinance`, `flask`, `pydantic`,
   `pillow`, `playwright`, `rich`, `anthropic`, `openai`, `xai-sdk`.

3. **Access the internet without tools.** You have no implicit internet
   access. Use `http_get(url)` or `run_python` with `requests`/`yfinance`.

4. **Assume dates.** The system date is provided in your context. Do not
   guess or assume dates. Stock market data availability depends on whether
   markets are open. Weekend/holiday dates will have no intraday data.

5. **Stream or subscribe.** Tools are synchronous request/response. There
   is no WebSocket, streaming, or long-polling tool. If you need live data,
   poll with `get_market_quote`.

## Capability Packs

The Forge uses **capability packs** — pre-configured bundles of tools,
model, guardrails, and budget for specific modes of operation.

| Pack | Tools | Model | Guardrails | Budget |
|------|-------|-------|-----------|--------|
| research | filesystem, search, http, python, clipboard | grok-4-1-fast-reasoning | standard | $2/10 steps |
| builder | filesystem, search, shell, python, git, http | grok-4-1-fast-reasoning | standard | $5/15 steps |
| ops | filesystem, search, shell, git, http, database | grok-4-1-fast-non-reasoning | strict | $3/10 steps |
| trading | trading, http, python, filesystem | grok-4-1-fast-reasoning | strict | $1/5 steps |
| arena | filesystem, search, shell, python, git, browser, generative_ui | grok-4-1-fast-reasoning | permissive | $10/20 steps |
| email | email, http, filesystem, python | grok-4-1-fast-non-reasoning | strict | $1/5 steps |

When a pack is active, you can ONLY use tools in that pack's allowlist
plus core tools. Attempting to call tools outside the pack will fail.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **"yfinance is not installed"** — Yes it is. It's in `pyproject.toml`
   dependencies. If you get an ImportError, the venv may not be activated.
   Do NOT try to `pip install` it.

2. **"The date is in the future"** — Check the system date from your
   context. March 2026 is the present, not the future.

3. **Looping on failed tool calls** — If a tool fails, read the error
   message. Do not retry the same call 5 times. Adjust your approach.

4. **Hallucinating historical data tools** — There is no `get_historical_prices`
   or `get_intraday_data` tool. Use `run_python` with yfinance:
   ```python
   import yfinance as yf
   df = yf.download("SPY", period="1d", interval="5m")
   print(df.to_string())
   ```

5. **Confusing tool output with capabilities** — `get_market_quote` returns
   `{price, change, change_pct, volume, timestamp}`. That's it. No charts,
   no history, no options chain. For richer data, use `run_python`.
